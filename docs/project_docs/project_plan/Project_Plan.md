# Project Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive project plan for the development and launch of the multi-agent AI platform. It details the project phases, key milestones, a work breakdown structure (WBS), and an estimated timeline. The plan is designed to follow an Agile methodology, allowing for flexibility and iterative progress.

## 2. Project Phases and Timeline

The project is divided into three main phases, with an estimated total duration of 12 months for the initial enterprise-ready release.

- **Phase 1: MVP - Foundation & Core Functionality (Months 1-3)**
- **Phase 2: Expansion - Feature Enrichment & Integration (Months 4-6)**
- **Phase 3: Enterprise Scale - Advanced Features & Global Deployment (Months 7-12)**
